## Cancellation Red Flags

### Restrictive Methods
| Issue | Risk |
|-------|------|
| In-person only | HIGH |
| Certified mail required | HIGH |
| Specific employee required | HIGH |
| Multiple credentials needed | HIGH |
| No online/phone option | MEDIUM |

**FTC sued LA Fitness (Aug 2025)** for in-person/mail-only cancellation - "hundreds of millions in unwanted charges"

### Notice Periods
| Type | Example | Trap |
|------|---------|------|
| 30-day | "Notice 30 days prior to billing" | Must time precisely |
| 60-day | "60 days advance written notice" | Very restrictive |
| Specific dates | "By the 10th to stop on 17th" | Planet Fitness model |

### Early Termination Fees
- Flat buyout: $58-$250
- Remaining balance: May violate state law
- Check state caps

## Auto-Renewal Traps

### Detection Points
- "automatically renew", "auto-renew", "continuous membership"
- Narrow cancellation windows
- Contract-to-month-to-month conversion with rate increase

### Hidden Fees
- Annual "enhancement" fee (Planet Fitness: $49.99)
- Separate from monthly dues
- Often buried in contract

## Freeze/Pause Policies

### Common Fees
| Gym | Standard Freeze | Medical |
|-----|----------------|---------|
| Planet Fitness | $0-15/mo | Free with docs |
| LA Fitness | $10-15/mo | Free with note |
| Equinox | $30-50/mo | Free up to 6mo |

### Traps
- Minimum membership before freeze (30-90 days)
- Duration caps (3 months/year)
- Auto-resume billing
- **Contract extension:** Freeze time added to term
