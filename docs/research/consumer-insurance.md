# Consumer Insurance Policy Analyzer Framework

## Key Red Flags to Detect

### 1. Actual Cash Value (ACV) vs Replacement Cost Value (RCV)
- **Flag:** "actual cash value" for belongings or structures
- **Impact:** 10-year-old roof worth $10K to replace might only yield $5K after depreciation
- **Example clause:** "We will pay the actual cash value of the damaged property, which is the replacement cost minus depreciation."

### 2. Anti-Concurrent Causation (ACC) Clauses
- **Flag:** "whether or not any other cause or event contributes concurrently or in any sequence"
- **Impact:** If wind (covered) + flood (excluded) both damage home, ENTIRE claim can be denied
- **States that DON'T enforce:** CA, ND, WA, WV

### 3. Percentage Deductibles
- **Flag:** Deductibles as percentages (1-10%) for hurricane/wind/hail
- **Impact:** 5% hurricane deductible on $300K home = $15K out of pocket
- **Common in:** FL, AL, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX (hurricane); MO, KS, OK, NE (hail)

### 4. Named Perils vs Open Perils
- **Named perils:** Only listed events covered; policyholder must prove covered peril
- **Open perils:** Everything covered except exclusions; insurer must prove exclusion applies

### 5. Forced Arbitration
- **Flag:** "binding arbitration", "waiver of class action rights"
- **Impact:** Lose right to jury trial, decisions binding and hard to appeal

## Common Exclusions to Flag

### Homeowners
| Exclusion | Surprise Level |
|-----------|---------------|
| Flood damage | Very High - requires separate NFIP policy |
| Earthquake/earth movement | High - includes landslides, sinkholes |
| Sewer/water backup | High - requires endorsement |
| Mold damage | High - often sub-limits or excluded |
| Gradual water damage | High - slow leaks not covered |
| Vacant home (30-60+ days) | Medium - coverage may void |

### Auto
- Business use of personal vehicle (rideshare, delivery)
- Personal belongings inside vehicle (limited/excluded)
- Gap coverage issue: Vehicles depreciate ~20% year 1

### Renters
- Roommates' belongings (only policyholder covered)
- High-value items above sub-limits (jewelry often capped $1K-$2.5K)
- Off-premises only 10% of belongings value

## Premium Traps

### Hidden Fees
- Administrative/policy fees
- Installment fees for monthly payments
- Late payment penalties
- Reinstatement fees

### Claims-Based Rate Increases
- Even inquiries appear on claims history (CLUE database)
- History follows you 5-7 years
- Multiple claims can result in non-renewal

## High-Risk Phrases to Flag

| Phrase | Risk | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| "at our sole discretion" | High | Insurer has unilateral power |
| "concurrent or in any sequence" | Critical | ACC clause |
| "actual cash value" | High | Depreciation applies |
| "medically necessary" | Medium | Subjective denial basis |
| "binding arbitration" | High | Waives court rights |
| "percentage of Coverage A" | High | Percentage deductible |
