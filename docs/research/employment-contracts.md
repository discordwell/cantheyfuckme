# Employment Contract Analyzer Framework

## Non-Compete Red Flags

### Overly Broad Terms
| Red Flag | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Geographic scope | "anywhere in North America" when company only operates in one state |
| Duration | More than 1-2 years |
| Vague industry | "any business that competes directly or indirectly" |
| No consideration | Presented after employment begins with no raise/promotion |

### State-by-State Rules (2025)

**Full Bans:**
- California (since 1872, strengthened 2024)
- Minnesota (2023)
- North Dakota
- Oklahoma
- Montana (limited)

**Salary Thresholds:**
| State | Non-Compete Threshold | Non-Solicitation |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|
| Illinois | $75,000 | $45,000 |
| Colorado | $127,091 | $76,254.60 |
| Washington | $123,394 (employees) | N/A |
| Washington | $308,485 (contractors) | N/A |

**California Requirements (2024):**

- Any existing non-compete is unenforceable

## Arbitration Clause Problems

### Red Flags
| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Mandatory pre-dispute arbitration | Waives jury trial |
| Class action waiver | Makes small claims unfeasible |
| Cost-shifting | Employee pays arbitration fees |
| Confidentiality requirements | Hides employer misconduct patterns |
| Shortened statute of limitations | Reduces filing time |

### Scale
- 60+ million U.S. workers bound by mandatory arbitration
- Under 2% of claims that would be litigated are brought to arbitration

## IP & Invention Assignment

### Red Flags
| Issue | Example |
|-------|---------|
| All-encompassing scope | "all inventions conceived during employment" |
| Post-employment assignment | "inventions within 12 months of termination" |
| No prior inventions carve-out | Missing Schedule A |
| Missing state notices | CA employers must notify of Labor Code 2870 |

### State Protections

- Created entirely on employee's own time
- Without using employer's resources
- That don't relate to employer's business
